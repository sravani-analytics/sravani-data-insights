# 🐍 Python Project: Data Cleaning & Business Rules

This project demonstrates **end-to-end data wrangling and automation** using Python (Pandas, NumPy).  
It reflects my ability to handle real-world datasets, apply conditional logic, and deliver structured outputs — as highlighted in my professional experience and Skillovilla training.

---

## 🔧 Features
- Created and managed DataFrames from raw tables, exported structured `.csv` outputs
- Applied **data cleaning techniques**: imputed missing values, standardized formats, merged datasets
- Implemented **conditional logic**: promotion/demotion rules based on project status and age
- Applied **aggregations**: total project cost per employee, city-level filtering
- Automated workflows to reduce manual effort and improve reporting consistency

---

## 📈 Results
- Delivered a consolidated **Final DataFrame** with enriched insights
- Automated repetitive cleaning tasks, saving significant manual effort
- Produced clear reporting outputs for employee costs and project performance
- Demonstrated ability to handle **real-world data challenges** with Python fundamentals

---

## 🚀 Business Impact
- Strengthened decision-making by providing **clean, structured datasets** ready for analysis
- Reduced manual debugging and reporting time through automation
- Showcased ability to bridge **engineering expertise with analytics workflows**

---

## 📂 Deliverables
- **Python Script:** `data_cleaning.py`  
- **Documentation:** README with features, results, and business impact  

⚠️ Note: Dataset not included due to confidentiality. The `.py` script contains the full workflow logic.
